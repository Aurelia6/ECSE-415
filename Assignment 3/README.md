The folder 'Assignment 3 - Aur√©lia Haas' contains 2 elements:
- README file
- Assignement3.ipynb

The library used were the following:
- matplotlib
- numpy
- cv2
- math
- pandas
- glob
- randoms
- sklearn
- warnings


Path variable to access images: '/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/ECSE 415/Assignment 3/'

Some of the code written is based on Tutorials 5 and 6, on the lecture slides, especially lecture 8, on the Appendices from assignment 3 and on online sources with hyperlinks commented in the code.
In addition, similarly to what has been done in tutorial 5 for the Viola-Jones algorithm, I had to add the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file in my path folder and use it as is.
