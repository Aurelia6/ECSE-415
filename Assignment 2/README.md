The folder 'Assignment 2 - Aurélia Haas' contains 2 elements:
- README file
- Assignement2.ipynb

The library used were the following:
- matplotlib
- numpy
- cv2
- math

Path variable to access images: '/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/ECSE 415/Assignment 2/images/'

Some of the code written is based on Tutorial 4.
In addition, when creating the sift variables, cv2.xfeatures2d.SIFT_create() did not work in the version installed, that is why I used cv2.SIFT_create(). Some elements are also printed are plotted, such as the descriptors or keypoints in some questions, even if it was not asked. This was done to make sure each step was correct.
